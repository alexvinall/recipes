## Ingredients
- 1.5–2 kg pork shoulder, sliced into thick 1–2 cm slabs
- 2–3 tbsp achiote paste
- 2–3 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1–2 chipotle peppers in adobo (optional, for heat)
- 1 tbsp paprika or mild chilli powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Juice of 1 orange (or ½ cup pineapple juice)
- Juice of 1 lime
- ½ cup chopped pineapple (fresh or tinned)
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 thick slice of fresh pineapple, for topping during cooking

## Method
1. **Soften the Guajillos**
   - Soak guajillo chiles in hot water for 10 minutes until soft.
2. **Blend the Marinade**
   - In a blender, combine softened guajillos, achiote paste, vinegar, garlic, chipotles, paprika, cumin, oregano, orange juice, lime juice, chopped pineapple and salt. Blend until smooth.
3. **Marinate the Pork**
   - Coat pork slices in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight.
4. **Slow Cook**
   - Add pork and all marinade to the slow cooker. Lay the thick pineapple slice on top. Cook on low for 7–8 hours or high for 4–5 hours, until the pork is fall-apart tender.
5. **Crisp in Oven**
   - Shred the pork. Spread on a lined baking tray. Roast at 220°C / 425°F for 15–20 minutes, tossing halfway, until the edges are crispy.
6. **Serve**
   - On toasted corn tortillas with toppings: pineapple chunks, coriander, lime and quick pickled onions.
